                The story takes place in Taishō era Japan, where a secret society, known as the Demon Slayer Corps, 
                has been waging a secret war against demons for centuries. The demons are former humans who were turned 
                into demons by Muzan Kibutsuji injecting them with his own blood, and they feed on humans and possess 
                upernatural abilities such as super strength, powers that demons can obtain called "Blood Demon Art", and 
                regeneration. Demons can only be killed if they are decapitated with weapons crafted from an alloy known 
                as Nichirin, injected with poison extracted from wisteria flowers, or exposed to sunlight. The Demon Slayers, 
                on the other hand, are entirely human. However, they employ special elemental breathing techniques, known as 
                "Breathing Styles", which grant them superhuman strength and increased resistance, helping them fight against 
                demons. The strongest Demon Slayers are known as the Hashira, and gain this rank through either killing a 
                member of the Twelve Kizuki (the twelve strongest demons under Muzan) or killing fifty demons after ranking 
                up multiple times.

            Since ancient times, we have existed to hunt down demons.The Demon Slayer Corps was founded by the Ubuyashiki family almost one thousand years ago. They led the battle against Demons and their greatest enemy, Muzan Kibutsuji. Each family member would eventually pass on the role of leadership to their descendants due to their bloodline being cursed. They recruit members from across Japan, many of whom had their lives ruined by Demons, to train in Breathing Style swordsmanship and secretly protect humanity. This constant battle against the Demons would last up until the Taisho-era (early 20th-century) of Japan when the main story takes place.</p>

                    <p class="text-synopsis content">An extremely cowardly boy who was forced to join the Demon Slayer Corps at around the same time as Tanjiro to pay for his debts, Zenitsu Agatsuma sometimes functions as comic relief. His cowardly personality is also used to contrast with Tanjiro's determined character. Zenitsu trained in the "Thunder Breathing" style by the former Thunder Hashira but was only able to learn the first form, and because of this he often belittles himself, despite the fact that he is talented. He joins up with Tanjiro on a mission and since then, he has tagged along with him, partially out of his infatuation with Nezuko, but also due to recognizing how honest and kind he is. His cowardly personality initially hinders him and he is only able to fight when he is unconscious or asleep, but he later learns to push his fears aside and take action when needed, to the point of developing a new, exclusive Thunder Breathing form. Zenitsu's sword is colored yellow and has a lightning bolt design. He has a heightened sense of hearing which allows him to distinguish a person's true character by the sound of their heartbeat and track demons.</p>

She is the protegé of Shinobu, the current Insect Hashira, and is being trained as a Tsuguko, or successor to the Hashira - however, it does not necessarily mean that she is an Insect Hashira nor has the same "breathing technique" as Shinobu. She uses the "Flower Breathing" style and is a highly-skilled fighter, but has difficulty functioning without being directly told what to do. She grew up in a poor, abusive household and was sold as a slave, leading her to shut off her emotions as a way to cope. Even after being rescued and taken in by Shinobu and Kanae, she would never do anything unless ordered, so Kanae gave her a coin to flip which she could use whenever she had trouble making decisions. She relies heavily on her coin flipping to make decisions until Tanjiro becomes friendly with her, which convinces her to use the coin less often and stick to her own intuition. She develops feelings for Tanjiro, to the point of risking her life to help save him when he was turned into a demon. Kanao's sword is colored light pink and her heightened sense of sight allows her to easily dodge enemy attacks, but she strains herself by overusing this ability during her fight with Doma, to the point of becoming blind in one eye. She is later revealed to have married Tanjiro, having two great-great-grandsons named Kanata and Sumihiko between them.</p>

After she sacrificed herself to save his life, he was raised by wild boars, and then taught to talk by an old man. Inosuke Hashibira uses a self-taught style called "Beast Breathing", along with two serrated swords in battle. When he gets new swords, he purposely chips them in order to match his preference and fighting style (much to his swordsmith's anger). Like Zenitsu, Inosuke is occasional comic relief for the series. He is portrayed as brash and prone to reacting violently, and while he appears dim, he proves himself in battle time after time. He is drawn as extremely muscular and rugged, which contrasts with his oddly effeminate face, which he normally hides under a boar's head mask. This mask was made from the head of his deceased boar mother, and he wears it in memory of her. When Inosuke first meets Tanjiro, he treats him as an enemy, but they quickly become friends as they fight together. He often challenges Tanjiro to competitions that are accepted in good spirits. He took the Demon Slayer Corps test at the same time as Tanjiro and Zenitsu and, unknown to most, became the first to clear it. Inosuke's swords are colored indigo gray. He has a heightened sense of touch, being able to locate enemies by feeling the vibrations in the air. Inosuke cannot read or write, and often forgets names or gets them completely wrong.</p>

Genya Shinazugawa is portrayed as a harsh and foul-mouthed individual obsessed with nothing beyond demon killing. His personality later changes after he fights beside Tanjiro to save the hidden Swordsmith Village. Unlike most other Demon Slayers, he is unable to use breathing techniques or traditional sword fighting styles. Instead, he eats parts of the demons he fights, and through his special digestive system, he temporarily gains demonic powers. His powers can be lesser or greater, depending on the strength of the demon he devours. When he utilize a demon's powers, he is also susceptible to a demon's weaknesses. Genya also carries a shotgun that shoots specialized bullets that are made of the same material as the Demon Slayers' Nichirin sword as well as a Nichirin wakizashi. He is the younger brother of Sanemi, the current Wind Hashira, who always avoids him, unaware that his older brother wants him to have a normal life. Genya is mortally wounded while assisting the Hashira against Kokushibo, reconciling with his brother before passing away. In the Reiwa Era, he and his brother are reincarnated as police officers.</p>

                    <p class="text-synopsis content">Muzan Kibutsuji was the first and strongest demon in existence. He used his blood to sire the other demons. He was able to manipulate his cellular structure and frequently disguised himself as different humans of various ages and genders. He would program transplanted cells within demons he directly sired to destroy them if they ever mentioned him by name. He could devour the cells of others to assimilate their abilities and memories as well. Muzan was originally a sickly young man from the Heian period whose transition into a demon was the result of an experimental treatment to prolong his life. He killed his doctor before realizing it worked. Muzan has since dedicated himself to "complete his treatment" by siring demons that would help him achieve his goal of overcoming his one weakness, sunlight. He also expressed a justified concern towards those who utilized the Sun Breathing technique since his near-death experience from fighting Yoriichi. This motivated him to attack Tanjiro's family in an attempt of turning at least one of them into a demon that was naturally immune to sunlight. Nezuko, the only survivor of the incident, eventually manifested that ability and Muzan focused his efforts on capturing and devouring her to remove his only weakness. The Demon Slayer Corps exploited Muzan's obsession and laid a trap for him which killed his remaining followers. Muzan killed Tamayo and many Demon Slayers before realizing that he was infected with a variation of the humanity-restoring serum that Tamayo and Shinobu developed with added poisons that removed most of his abilities and weakened him to be easily killed. This resulted in his body being destroyed by the sunlight when he is held back by the Demon Slayers. Muzan's final act of revenge was to turn Tanjiro into a new demon so he would kill the Demon Slayers. This was thwarted when Tanjiro turned back into a human with his friends' help.</p>

After completing her research on a cure for Nezuko's condition, Tamayo sacrifices herself to lay an ambush on Muzan with Kagaya's help but despite failing to kill her sworn enemy, she poisons the demon with a mix of substances she developed with Shinobu's help to greatly weaken him.</p>

                    <p class="text-synopsis content">A demon created by Tamayo. He cares for her greatly and is very protective of her. It has been implied that he loves her. He is the only demon made by Tamayo and as such, has no connection to Muzan. He only needs a small amount of blood to survive, even less than Tamayo. He is mentioned to have a "battle form" that he can change into. He has a special power that can erase the presence of living things as well as make the unseen seen. This technique is not perfect and the more people he attempts to hide, the easier it is to find them. After his master's death, Yushiro assists the Demon Slayers in the final battle against Muzan by providing aid to the wounded soldiers and helping Tanjiro and his friends evade Muzan's attacks with his detecting scrolls. After Muzan's defeat, Yushiro continues living as a demon all the way to modern times, where he makes a living as a painter.</p>

He initially tries to kill Nezuko but reconsiders after seeing her protect an unconscious Tanjiro. He sends them to his mentor Sakonji in the hopes that Tanjiro could succeed him and possibly cure Nezuko. Seemingly aloof and unemotional, he does not think of himself as a true Hashira, despite mastering Water Breathing, due to an inferiority complex that stemmed from survivor's guilt during Final Selection. He has developed an additional exclusive form of Water Breathing, which he alone knows. He loses an arm during the final battle against Muzan but survives after the demon is killed. In the Reiwa Era, Giyu's reincarnation/descendant is a child named Giichi, who is close friends with Sabito and Makomo's reincarnations.</p>

Though he was extremely optimistic, Kyojuro did sometimes have a sense of foreboding that those he believed in might die, especially his friends who he cared deeply for. He, like most Demon Slayers, absolutely detested demons, usually because of their heinous deeds or because of their clashing morale values. Despite this, Kyojuro recognized and accepted Nezuko as a member of the Demon Slayer Corps after seeing her risk her life to protect innocents, showing that Kyojuro was capable of not letting his hatred for demons cloud his judgement.</p>

                    <p class="text-synopsis content">Muzan's most powerful subordinate holding the title of Upper Rank One, Kokushibo was originally a Demon Slayer called Michikatsu Tsugikuni (継国 巌勝, Tsugikuni Michikatsu) and the older twin brother of Yoriichi. Envious of his brother's talent, he ends up tempted to join Muzan's side as a demon in order to eternally perfect himself as a swordsman without the worry of dying of sickness or old age. As a transformed Demon Slayer, Kokushibo uses a breathing style known as "Moon Breathing" (月の呼吸, Tsuki no kokyū), which directly derives from Yoriichi's Sun Breathing. He dies while fighting a combined effort of Gyomei, Sanemi, Genya, and Muichiro, with the latter two dying from their wounds soon after.</p>

                    <p class="text-synopsis content">Holding the position of Upper Rank Three, he is a demon who despises whoever he considers weak and offers those he considers strong enough to have his respect the chance to become demons. He was once a human called Hakuji (狛治) who stole as a child to care for his ailing father before he committed suicide to free his burdened son. Hakuji was adopted by a martial artist named Keizo and trained under him while falling in love with his master's daughter Koyuki. Hakuji loses his new family when they were poisoned by a rival dojo who were unable to beat him in a fair fight, leading him to slaughter them all single-handedly before being turned into a demon by Muzan. Akaza fatally wounds and kills Kyojuro and later battles Tanjiro and Giyu. During their battle, he regains his human memories and commits suicide by voluntarily ceasing his regeneration and dying from his wounds.</p>

As a child, he was seen by his parents as a perfect, blessed child, thus they started a religious cult around his figure. After his parents' deaths, he assumed control of the cult and after being transformed into a demon by Muzan, he started eating his followers on the notion that those he devoured will live forever inside him. One member of his cult was Inosuke's mother Kotoha, whom he devoured when she ran away from him upon learning his true nature. He also killed Shinobu's older sister Kanae. In a desperate measure to defeat him, Shinobu administers a massive dose of wisteria in her body and allows herself to be consumed by him. The weakened Doma is later killed by Kanao and Inosuke.</p>

He was once an ostracized villager who developed an obsession with corpses after his parents drowned out at sea and their bodies washed up on shore.

Her human name was Ume (梅, lit. syphilis), named after the disease that killed her mother, raised by Gyutaro in the red-light district slums they were born in. Her great beauty led to success in the district at a young age despite her volatile personality, until she was burned alive at age 13 by a samurai customer she blinded in the eye. She was on the verge of dying along with Gyutaro but was met by Doma, who made them demons and inherit his rank in the Upper Ranks. She uses an obi belt to absorb her victims and place them in a secret location before devouring them, serving as both her weapon and a semi independent extension of herself. She is beheaded by Zenitsu and Inosuke. After her death, Daki returns to her former appearance as Ume and meets Gyutaro in the afterlife. Ume refuses to leave Gyutaro's as he tries to pushing her away in an attempt to spare his sister an eternity in Hell, reminding her brother of their promise to survive anything together.</p>

As a human born in the red-light slums, he was ostracized and despised for his appearance due to being abused by his mother. Ume's presence gave him joy and allowed him to embrace his vile disposition while making a living as a debt collector, only to be mortally wounded after killing a customer who burned Ume alive and then turned into demon by Doma. He usually hides within Daki's body and emerges whenever her life was threatened. He fights using his poisonous blood and two demonic sickles, as the basis of his Blood Demon Art. As dual holders of Upper Rank Six, Gyutaro needs to be decapitated together with Daki to be truly killed. He is beheaded by Tengen and Tanjiro, having regrets over being a bad influence in his sister's life and almost lashing out in response to her insults in her final moments. While he resolved in going to Hell alone to atone for both their sins, Ume refuses to leave his side and he relents.</p>
